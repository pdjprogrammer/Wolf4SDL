<h1 align="center"><em>DDWolf</em></h1>

DDWolf is a fork of the Wolf4SDL engine for Wolfenstein3D aimed at brigning modern QOL improvements while still preserving the game as pure and close to the original as possible.

<h2><em>Wolf4SDL</em></h2>

Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org).

The overall work to get to where we are would not be possible without the following people, more credits at the end of the readme.

- Original Wolfenstein 3D by id Software (http://www.idsoftware.com)
- Wolf4SDL by Moritz "Ripper" Kroll (http://www.chaos-software.de.vu - OFFLINE)
- Modifications to r262 by Andy_Nonymous and others (http://diehardwolfers.areyep.com/viewtopic.php?t=6693)

<h2><em>Main features</em></h2>

* HD Resolution support.
  - The game will automatically detect your main monitor's resolution
  and be set accordingly.
    - No more screen resolution change on launch!
    - Can still manually specify resolution using launch parameter.
* Modern control scheme (OPTIONAL).
  - Dedicated strafing buttons (WASD).
  - Can disable mouse Y axis.
  - #MODERN_CONTROL flag in version.h to enable or disable.
    - Original control scheme available.
* Better controller support (only action button can be remapped).
  - Left analog stick : Move/Strafe
  - Right analog stick : Rotate
  - Left / Right shoulders : Previous and Next weapon
  - Back/Start Button
  - 4 Action Buttons (Can be remapped)
    - A : Fire
    - B : Strafe (mapped to key but not useful for now with controller)
    - Y : Run
    - X : Open door
* AlumiuN's Advanced Sound Manager (Some modifications by WSJ)
* Set of 10 customizable "actions" and menu to assign/remap those buttons.
  - For modders to add their own actions more easily (Code changes required to implement custom actions).

<h2><em>Feature Flags</em></h2>

```
#USE_MODERN_CONTROLS
#VIEASM                     AlumiuN's Advanced Sound Manager. 
                            Some modifications made by WSJ.

```

<h2><em>Wolf4SDL Additional features</em></h2>

* High-resolution texture support:
  - Wolf4SDL supports textures up to 256x256 dynamically. No need for any code change.
* Two additional view sizes:
  - Wolf4SDL supports one view size using the full width of the screen and showing the status bar, like in Mac-enstein, and one view size filling the whole screen (press TAB to see the status bar).
* (Nearly) unlimited sound and song lengths:
  - Mod developers are not restricted to 64kB for digitized sounds and IMF songs anymore, so longer songs and digitized sounds with better quality are possible.
* Resuming ingame music:
  - When you come back to the game from the menu or load a save game, the music will be resumed where it was suspended rather than started from the beginning.
* Freely movable pushwalls: 
  - Moving pushwalls can be viewed from all sides, allowing mod developers to place them with fewer restrictions. The player can also follow the pushwall directly instead of having to wait until the pushwall has left a whole tile.
* Optional integrated features for mod developers:
  - Wolf4SDL already contains the shading, directional 3D sprites, floor and ceiling textures, high resolution textures/sprites, parallax sky, cloud sky and outside atmosphere features, which can be easily activated in version.h.
* AdLib sounds and music:
  - This port includes the OPL2 emulator from MAME, so you can not only hear the AdLib sounds but also music without any AdLib-compatible soundcard in near to perfect quality!
* Multichannel digitized sounds:
  - Digitized sounds play on 8 channels! So in a fire fight you will always hear, when a guard opens the door behind you ;)
* Higher screen resolutions:
  - Aside from the original 320x200 resolution, Wolf4SDL currently supports any resolutions being multiples of 320x200 or 320x240, the default being 640x400.
  - Unlike some other ports, Wolf4SDL does NOT apply any bilinear or similar filtering, so the graphics are NOT blurred but pixelated just as we love it.

The following versions of Wolfenstein 3D data files are currently supported by the source code (choose the version by commenting/uncommenting lines in version.h as described in that file):

<h2><em>How to play</em></h2>

<p>To play Wolfenstein 3D with Wolf4SDL, you just have to copy the original data files (e.g. *.WL6) into the same directory as the Wolf4SDL executable.</p>

<p>Please make sure, that you use the correct version of the executable with the according data files version as the differences are hardcoded into the binary!</p>

<p>You also need to have SDL2.dll (2.0.18) and SDL_Mixer.dll (2.0.4) in the same directory as the EXE.</p>

<p>If you play in windowed mode (--windowed parameter), press SCROLLLOCK or F12 to grab the mouse. Press it again to release the mouse.</p>

<h2><em>Usage</em></h2>

Wolf4SDL supports the following command line options :
```
 --help                 This help page
 --tedlevel <level>     Starts the game in the given level
 --baby                 Sets the difficulty to baby for tedlevel
 --easy                 Sets the difficulty to easy for tedlevel
 --normal               Sets the difficulty to normal for tedlevel
 --hard                 Sets the difficulty to hard for tedlevel
 --nowait               Skips intro screens
 --windowed[-mouse]     Starts the game in a window [and grabs mouse]
 --res <width> <height> Sets the screen resolution (must be multiple of 320x200 or 320x240)
 --resf <w> <h>         Sets any screen resolution >= 320x200 (which may result in graphic errors)
 --bits <b>             Sets the screen color depth (Use this when you have palette/fading problem or perhaps to optimize speed on old systems.)
                        Allowed: 8, 16, 24, 32, default: "best" depth.
 --nodblbuf             Don't use SDL's double buffering
 --extravbls <vbls>     Sets a delay after each frame, which may help to reduce flickering (SDL does not support vsync...)
                        (unit is currently 8 ms, default: 0)
 --joystick <index>     Use the index-th joystick if available
 --joystickhat <index>  Enables movement with the given coolie hat
 --samplerate <rate>    Sets the sound sample rate (given in Hz)
 --audiobuffer <size>   Sets the size of the audio buffer (-> sound latency, given in bytes)
 --ignorenumchunks      Ignores the number of chunks in VGAHEAD.* (may be useful for some broken mods)
 --configdir <dir>      Directory where config file and save games are stored (Windows default: current directory, others: $HOME/.wolf4sdl)

For Spear of Destiny the following additional options are available:
 --mission <mission>    Mission number to play (1-3)

```

<h2><em>Compiling from source code</em></h2>

The current version of the source code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/brosseaualex/Wolf4SDL

**_What you need:_**

- C++ Compiler
- SDL 2 Libraries

**_Preferred methods for compiling the source code:_**

- Visual C++ (2019/2022)
  - [VS 2022] - Wolf4SDL.VC2022.sln
  - [VS 2019] - Wolf4SDL.VC2019.sln
    - README-VC.txt
- Dev-C++ 5.0 Beta 9.2 (4.9.9.2)
  - Wolf4SDL.dev
    - README-devcpp.txt
- Code::Blocks 8.02
  - Wolf4SDL.cbp
    - README-codeblocks.txt
- CMake
- [Untested] Makefile (for Linux, BSD variants and MinGW/MSYS)
- [Untested] Xcode (for Mac OS X, macosx/Wolf4SDL.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)

**_Deprecated / outdated / unsupported / possibly broken_**

- Special compiling for Dreamcast (see README-dc.txt)
- Special compiling for GP2X (see README-GP2X.txt)

<h2><em>Important</em></h2>

Do not forget to take care of version.h!

By default it compiles for "Wolfenstein 3D 1.4 full GT/ID/Activision"!

If _CONFIG.WL6_ exists while you switch between the 'USE_MODERN_CONTROLS' flag, **_you have to delete the file so the game can re-create it._**

**_There will be issues with controls if this step is not done._**

<h2><em>SDL Libraries</em></h2>

The required SDL libraries are already included in the folder "libraries" and it is not required to download them.

See the readme for the compiler you are using for more information on how to use those libraries.

The SDL and SDL_Mixer versions used in this project are the following :
 - SDL2 2.0.18 (https://www.libsdl.org/release/)
   - Visual Studio: _SDL2-devel-2.0.18-VC.zip_
   - Other: _SDL2-devel-2.0.18-mingw.tar.gz_
 - SDL2_mixer 2.0.4 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/)
   - Visual Studio: _SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip_
   - Other: _SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz_

<h2><em>Troubleshooting</em></h2>

 - If your frame rate is low, consider using the original screen resolution (--res 320 200) or lowering the sound quality (--samplerate 22050)

<h2><em>TODOs</em></h2>

 - Center non-ingame screens for resolutions being a multiple of 320x240.
 - Add support for any graphic resolution >= 320x200.
